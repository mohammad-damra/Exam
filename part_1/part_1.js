/*

PART 1 [Full-Stack Application]: 

Solve the following questions in the `library-app` folder

Q1) Connect the server to a database.

Q2) Create an API `/books` to insert a new book to the database, it should have (title , author, pages, publisher, published_at)

Q3) Create an API `/books` to get all the books from the database.

Q4) Create an API `/books/:book_id` to get a specific book from the database.

Q5) Create an API `/books/:book_id` to delete a specific book from the database

Q6) Add a frontend route `/library/create_book` to render the inputs that correspond to the book's attributes and a `submit` button (without functionality).

Q7) Add a frontend route `/library` that will render all the books (title and author) from the database.

Q8) Add a frontend route `/library/:book_id` that will render a specific book details from the database.

Q9) When the `submit` button is clicked (from Q6) it should add a new book in the database, by sending a request to the correct endpoint in the backend.

Q10) When rendering the book list (from Q7) add a delete button next to each book, that when clicked will delete the corresponding book from the database and the state.
